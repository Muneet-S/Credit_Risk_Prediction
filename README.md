# Credit_Risk_Prediction
Machine Learning techniques to predict credit default risk.


This project is focused on creating a predictive model to evaluate default risk in financial transactions. Leveraging April 2018 originations data, the model utilizes customer demographics and transaction history as features to assess the likelihood of default. By analyzing response rates and expected revenue, the model proposes strategies to mitigate default risk. The method involves training a machine learning model and evaluating its performance using key metrics such as AUC. The project's goal is to provide valuable insights to the company, enabling informed decision-making and proactive risk management in financial transactions.
